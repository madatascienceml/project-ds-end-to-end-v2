"""RAG evaluation (Block 16): retrieval hit rate + manual faithfulness review.

Two separate concerns, two separate functions:

1. evaluate_hit_rate() — quantitative, automated. Extends the 10 queries
   already used in test_retrieval.py (Block 14) with 8 more for full
   7-section coverage (the original 10 never touched
   `characteristic_findings_by_grade`), reports hit_rate@3 and top-1
   accuracy against a hand-labelled ground truth.

2. evaluate_faithfulness() — qualitative, manual. Deliberately NOT scored
   by another LLM call: at this project's scale (2 cases), a human
   reading generated text against its source chunks side by side is more
   trustworthy than an unverified LLM-judge, and avoids compounding one
   model's potential errors with another's. Makes real generate_report()
   API calls (gpt-4o-mini) — not mocked.
