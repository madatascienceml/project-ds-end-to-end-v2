# Retinal Screening Triage System

## Problem

Virtual diabetic-patient clinics generate a growing backlog of fundus
photographs awaiting ophthalmologist review. This system assists that
review queue: it classifies each image by diabetic retinopathy severity
(ICDRSS grade 0-4), applies a deterministic clinical rule engine to
propose a triage action and follow-up interval, and uses a RAG-grounded
LLM to draft a structured pre-report — reducing the manual first-pass
review burden while keeping a clinician in the loop for every decision.

## Architecture

```
Fundus image
     │
     ▼
EfficientNetB0 (fine-tuned)  →  predicted grade (0-4) + confidence
     │
     ▼
Deterministic rule engine  →  action + follow-up interval
     │  (grade + confidence + HbA1c + diabetes_years + spherical_refraction)
     ▼
RAG retrieval over clinical guideline corpus  →  relevant passages
     │
     ▼
LLM (gpt-4o-mini)  →  structured clinical pre-report (drafts only —
     │                  never re-reads or overrides the rule engine's
     │                  action/interval/grade fields)
     ▼
Streamlit app  →  image + Grad-CAM heatmap + report for clinician review
```

## Results

| Model | QWK | Grade 3 Recall |
|---|---|---|
| Baseline CNN | 0.4972 | 0.103 |
| EfficientNetB0 (feature extraction) | 0.7910 | 0.586 |
| **EfficientNetB0 (fine-tuned, final)** | **0.7987** | **0.690** |

The fine-tuned model was selected as final based on Grade 3 recall —
catching severe cases was prioritized over overall accuracy or QWK
alone, since a missed severe case carries far higher clinical cost
than a false positive.

**Per-class recall (fine-tuned model)**:

| Grade | Recall |
|---|---|
| 0 | 0.952 |
| 1 | 0.309 |
| 2 | 0.353 |
| 3 | 0.690 |
| 4 | 0.455 |

Note the pattern here matches the Grad-CAM finding below: Grades 0 and
4 (the clear extremes) are recalled well, while the intermediate
grades (1, 2, 3) — which are harder to distinguish visually, as
independently confirmed by clinical experience — show lower recall.

**RAG retrieval performance**: hit rate@3 = 100%, hit rate@1 ≈ 78%
(7-chunk clinical guideline corpus — see Limitations).

## Key Findings

- **Model attention**: Grad-CAM analysis shows the model's attention
  concentrates on the optic disc across all severity grades, rather
  than shifting toward grade-specific lesions. This is independently
  corroborated by clinical experience: Grade 0 and Grade 4 are easy to
  distinguish visually, but the boundaries between Grade 1↔2 and
  Grade 3↔4 are genuinely harder to separate — for the model and for a
  human reviewer alike. This is documented as a real finding about the
  task's difficulty, not treated as a model flaw to hide.

- **Follow-up intervals**: The rule engine's follow-up intervals
  (12/6/6/1/1 months for grades 0-4) are clinically defined, not
  learned or invented. Grade 3's 1-month interval is intentionally
  stricter than the typical 3-4 month screening standard — full
  rationale documented in `data/guidelines/icdrss_guidelines.md`.

## Limitations

- **Synthetic data**: Patient intake data used in the demo (HbA1c,
  diabetes duration, spherical refraction, age, visual acuity) is
  synthetically generated for demonstration purposes — it does not
  come from real patients.
- **Partial rule engine scope**: Only 3 of 5 captured intake fields
  (HbA1c, diabetes_years, spherical_refraction) currently feed the
  rule engine's modifiers. Age and visual_acuity are captured but not
  yet incorporated — a known, accepted scope limit for this phase.
- **RAG corpus size**: The clinical guideline corpus is intentionally
  small (7 sections/chunks). Retrieval hit rate@3 is 100%, top-1 is
  ~78% — an accepted limitation of a small corpus, not an area under
  active optimization (a chunk-prefix experiment was tried and
  reverted after it made retrieval worse).
- **Optional deployment layer skipped**: A FastAPI/Docker deployment
  layer (Block 19 of the project workflow) was deliberately not
  implemented, per the original scope plan — documented in
  `docs/workflow.md`.

## ⚠️ Not a Diagnostic Device

This system is a decision-support prototype developed for educational
purposes. It is **not** a certified medical device and has **not** been
validated, approved, or cleared by any regulatory body (e.g. FDA, CE
marking, AEMPS). All outputs — grade predictions, triage
recommendations, and generated reports — are intended solely to assist
a licensed ophthalmologist's review and must never be used as the sole
basis for a clinical decision. Final diagnosis and treatment decisions
remain the sole responsibility of the treating clinician.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/madatascienceml/project-ds-end-to-end-v2.git
   cd project-ds-end-to-end-v2
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables — create a `.env` file in the project
   root with your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

5. Trained model weights are hosted on Hugging Face Hub (not included
   in this repository — see `.gitignore`, `models/*`). Download it
   with:
   ```bash
   pip install huggingface_hub
   python -c "from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download; hf_hub_download(repo_id='manudaza/retinal-triage-efficientnetb0', filename='efficientnetb0_finetuned_patched.keras', local_dir='models/')"
   ```
   Or download manually from the
   [model repo](https://huggingface.co/manudaza/retinal-triage-efficientnetb0)
   and place it at `models/efficientnetb0_finetuned_patched.keras`.

## Usage

Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

This opens a local web interface with two tabs:
- **Screening**: upload a fundus image (or use a pre-filled synthetic
  intake form), view the predicted grade, Grad-CAM heatmap, triage
  decision, and the generated clinical pre-report.
- **Insights**: model performance summary (QWK, per-grade recall, RAG
  retrieval metrics), a summary of the current session's processed
  cases (grade distribution and automation rate), and a link to the
  full Tableau dashboard.

To explore the underlying notebooks (EDA, preprocessing, model
training, evaluation):
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/
```
